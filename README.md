- Analysis based on information available in this [link to dashboard](https://public.tableau.com/views/citiBikeAnalysis_16404938519610/citiBikeAnalysis?:language=en-US&publish=yes&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link)

## Overview

The main objective of this analysis is to provide information to sustain that it's profitable to start a company of bikesharing. This is accomplished by showing different dimensions of information charted in key presentations.

## Results

### Trip duration

Most trips have a duration between 5 and 20 minutes, meaning the users of the service most probably use it to run errands in the vicinity of their home or workplace, or, otherwise, that an important percentage use the service specifically to run errands in the nearby area.

### Trip duration by gender

According to this image, most of the users are men, which reinforces the idea that a high percentage of users are delivery persons.

### Use habits by days and hours

To study the use by day and hour we must first consider the "working" weekdays (monday to friday) and we can observe that the hours of highest use are from 7 to 10 am and from 5 to 8 pm; this leads to the conclusion that most users require the service as transportation to and from work. When we turn to the non-working weekdays (saturday and sunday) we can observe that most of the use is precisely during the hours between 10 am and 8 pm; which lets us think that the users require transportation for leisure and other errands that do not require to be completed during specific times (yet, not too early nor too late).

### Use habits by days and hours for each gender

From this series of images we can observe the same paterns before described for both women and men, while the unknown category has higher use during sundays. 

### User types

![5_user_type](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89816213/147399545-8e452ba0-13b8-45cc-b696-010b504b4dc1.PNG)

We can see that most of the users are actually subscribers, meaning that their schedule is already adapted to common use of the service, most likely in workdays.

### User types by gender

![6_gender_usertype-days](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89816213/147399551-1d09ec36-8710-48f9-aef1-14a920d9b2d6.PNG)

This image lets us dive deeper into the trend observed earlier, and uncuestionably shows that most users must be working men transporting to and from work. As for non subscribers use, the use is most common during non-working days, meaning people might be using the service to run errands and leaisure activities, but the use is not frequent enough to make it redituable to subscribe to the service.

### Top starting points

![7_starting_points](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/89816213/147399555-df11dabc-4746-42f8-9999-2653139472ed.PNG)

Some of the most frequently used stations are in touristic landmarks, which points to high usage probably of tourists. We must see not let this distract us from the real need, which is to obtain a higher number of subscribers; which demands us to ensure that commutes are considered for areas with high number of points  but not as frequented.

## Summary

From the information above we can see that it's redituable to start a bikesharing service, since the service is widely used and the presence of so highly used stations means that there is probably a shortage of bikes in the zone, as well as higher chances to amplify service around the dotted area.
